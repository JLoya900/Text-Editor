## Installation

* This text editor necessitates the implementation of various methods and the storage of data in an IndexedDB database during its development process.

* This application will require the installation of Node.js and various npm packages.

*   Node Package Manager (npm) is a sophisticated software manager and installer that facilitates the seamless integration of modules into a Node.js project. It not only ensures the proper placement of these modules for utilization but also adeptly manages any conflicts arising from dependencies. The initialization process for npm begins with the command **npm init**, resulting in the generation of a comprehensive package.json file. This file encapsulates all the pertinent application details provided by the user during the npm initialization phase.


* The required modules are bundled in the package.json file and at CLI or integrated terminal type in **npm run install**, the modules will be installed.
